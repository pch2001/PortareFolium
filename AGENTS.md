# AGENTS.md

This is the canonical agent manifest for this project. Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Google Gemini all read from here.
Directives, prompts, and reference assets live under `.agents/`. Tool-specific config (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`) only holds tool-local settings.

## User directives (canonical)

Direct edits go here.

- [.agents/directives/01-behavior.md](.agents/directives/01-behavior.md) — Persona, chat rules, autonomous workflow (TODO.md), behavioral guidelines.
- [.agents/directives/02-code.md](.agents/directives/02-code.md) — Coding rules, comment formatting, file naming, testing policy.
- [.agents/directives/03-design.md](.agents/directives/03-design.md) — Design system, Tailwind usage, UI implementation details.
- [.agents/directives/04-workflow.md](.agents/directives/04-workflow.md) — Branch strategy, commit/PR conventions, testing gates, documentation.
- [.agents/directives/05-architecture.md](.agents/directives/05-architecture.md) — Project structure, directory layout, PDF export, pitfalls, MCP guide.

## OMC directives (auto-synced from `.claude/rules/`)

Do not edit directly — managed by oh-my-claudecode. `scripts/sync-omc-directives.mjs` mirrors `.claude/rules/` (gitignored) into `.agents/directives/omc/` (tracked snapshot) on `pnpm install` and pre-commit.

- [.agents/directives/omc/coding-style.md](.agents/directives/omc/coding-style.md)
- [.agents/directives/omc/git-workflow.md](.agents/directives/omc/git-workflow.md)
- [.agents/directives/omc/karpathy-guidelines.md](.agents/directives/omc/karpathy-guidelines.md)
- [.agents/directives/omc/performance.md](.agents/directives/omc/performance.md)
- [.agents/directives/omc/security.md](.agents/directives/omc/security.md)
- [.agents/directives/omc/testing.md](.agents/directives/omc/testing.md)

User directives take precedence over OMC directives on conflict.
